# Blog content license legalese

This page contains all the documentation

## TL;DR

-   Text + graphics I made are licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0, unless otherwise noted.
    
-   Code snippets I made are licensed under a separate license to avoid license conflicts hellscape and due to non-suitability of CC licenses on software and source code, the MIT license, unless otherwise noted. (As always, check the `SPDX-License-Identifier` comment header and embed captions.)
    
-   Anything else is not covered by this policy, including embedded content. Make sure to check the image caption and additional editor notes at the end of a blog post for credits.
    
-   When in doubt, don’t ask to ask. Just ask about your situation to one of my contact details. In case you want to reuse my content without attribution, a one-time monetary compensation might be required on a case-by-case basis.
    

## Text and graphics

Text and graphics (if they’re originally made by myself) in blog posts from Andrei Jiroh are licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0 (see legal code). Any third-party content, including the ones he paid through commissions, will be labelled as such.

### What about IRL photos?

The blanket license doesn't include IRL photos posted online by me, my family, friends and relatives. If you want to use that, ask both me and whoever posted it.

## Source code

Source code is a [tricky hellscape to use CC BY-SA,](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/a/1718/21717) especially for Stack Overflow/Exchange users, since:

-   it doesn’t mention source code and patents (AKA [license proliferation shitfuckery](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/a/1719/21717))
    
-   isn’t compatible with major software licenses (other than [one-way compatibility with GPL](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/ShareAlike_compatibility:_GPLv3))
    

While the MIT license might also experience the license proliferation shitfuckery issue, code snippets from my blog will use both MIT and MPl-2.0 license unless otherwise specified.

## What if I need to reuse content, but without credit? (or anything else)

Just ask. Depending on your use case, you might be asked to pay a one-time monetary compensation to cover custom licensing costs, which can be negotiable on your inquiry.

For third-party content in blog posts, look for credits to get information about who and where to contact.
