Sometimes, being busy in school I miss posting status updates by a few weeks up to the point I’m considering going quarterly status updates instead of doing this every two months, although like ~sircmpwn, I might not be able to do it on time and maybe get consolidated into one to avoid backlogs on the pile of Substack drafts behind the scenes.

## For fanfic writers and fan artists, here’s your another (cursed) ~~prompt~~ hellscape

Sure, I might technically be having a field day in both Lackadaisy and Murder Drones communities (and more), but yeah…

(If you have no idea about Yupia (or WTFBBQ why we're talking about Story X in Gildedguy's Discord in relation to that), then please behold and watch “Erase Humanity” on YouTube.)

### What about Ranboo’s Generation Loss?

That was nerve-wracking to watch, especially MTRCB would (technically the video description mentioned it) rate this as R-18. Also bless anyone who were traumatized after the finale (context via this custom Red Screen of Death below).

If you want a bit of mixtaping from hell while we wait for the official soundtrack (I'm late to the news if they did it by the time I publish this, sorry), here’s [my SoundCloud playlist](https://soundcloud.com/ajhalili2006/sets/mixtaped-socialexperiments) (you can also find this on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGqidsjkmgSKuEzbaC0GIx_oEJarJZ6gC) and Spotify at your will).

## The “what could go wrong” Twitter handle change

To make my username match across platforms, I decided to officially change mine after literally years being stuck on my childhood-ish Twitter username (good that older posts before I reach 13 were automagically nuked to hell as part of birthdate change for obvious privacy reasons)

But before that happened, I did some switch-and-bait on Keybase behind the scenes and this happened. Musk always love violence against third-party devs and literally every single API user,
