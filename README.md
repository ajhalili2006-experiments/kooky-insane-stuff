This repository contains content ranging from his personal character dossiers [^1] in different fandoms to some of the unholy grails from the back of his mind.

Don't worry, he's probably fine [^2] other than the regular internalized ableism and too much on "beating himself up harder every time he fucked up" as (actually) Autistic (currently masking like hell IRL) person.

## How tf we got here?

> From Nori Doorman's wiki page in Murder Drones Fandom for context, under trivia section:
>> _A closet containing "NORI'S KOOKY INSANE STUFF" is seen in [The Promening](https://breezewiki.pussthecat.org/murder-drones/wiki/The_Promening), where Khan stores Uzi's crazed ramblings, hinting at her having a paranoid side to her similar to her daughter as during the events of [Cabin Fever](https://breezewiki.pussthecat.org/murder-drones/wiki/Cabin_Fever), Khan explained to Uzi that Nori would tell him to prepare for the "upcoming sky demons", "scary singularities" and a "cool 'S' [she] can draw"._
